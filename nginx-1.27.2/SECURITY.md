## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities via one of the following methods
(in order of preference):

1. [Report a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
within this repository. We are using the Github workflow that allows us to
manage vulnerabilities in a private manner and to interact with reporters
securely.

2. [Report directly to F5](https://www.f5.com/services/support/report-a-vulnerability).

3. Report via email to security-alert@nginx.org.
This method will be deprecated in the future.
